System design playground implementing real-world backend problems using Java and TypeScript with a focus on scalable domain modeling, clean architecture, and production-grade thinking

## Tech Stack

Languages used in this repository:

Java for DSA-oriented and interview-friendly backend modeling  
TypeScript for Node.js-style domain and service design

The same system is often implemented in both languages to ensure
language-agnostic system design understanding.

## Design Philosophy

Domain-first system design  
Explicit state transitions instead of boolean flags  
Clear separation of responsibilities  
Extensible pricing and payment models  
Focus on real-world constraints and edge cases

The code intentionally evolves over time to reflect how systems grow in production.

This repository represents continuous learning and daily progress toward
building production-grade backend systems suitable for high-scale environments.
